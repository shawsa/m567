Setup grid and initialize variables

    u*, v* = advectDiffuse

        u_adv, v_adv are calculated from upwinding

        update ghost nodes for implicit solve

        calculate u* using sparse solver

        calculate v* using sparse solver

        update ghost nodes for explicit solve

    p, lgmult = pressure

        calculate the divergence (ie right-hand side)
    
        find pressure-correction using sparse solver and a Lagrange multiplier

        update the ghost nodes

    u, v = correct

        compute the pressure gradient

        calculate u^{n+1} from u* and the pressure gradient 
        
        calculate v^{n+1} from v* and the pressure gradient
