\hspace{-.5 ex}\problem{1} \emph{Linear multi-step methods} The following are six suggestions for linear multistep methods for solving
the initial value problem $y'=f(t,y(t))$, $a \leq t \leq b$, $y(a) = y_0$:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item $y^{n+1} = \frac{1}{2}\left[y^{n} + y^{n-1}\right] + 2kf^{n}$
	\item $y^{n+1} = y_j$
	\item $y^{n+1} = y^{n-3} + \frac{4}{3}k\left[f^{n} + f^{n-1} + f^{n-2}\right]$
	\item $y^{n+1} = y^{n-1} + \frac{1}{3}k\left[7f^{n} - 2f^{n-1} + f^{n-2}\right]$
	\item $y^{n+1} = \frac{8}{19}\left[y^{n} - y^{n-2}\right] + y^{n-3} + \frac{6}{19}k\left[f^{n+1} + 4f^{n} + 4f^{n-2} + f^{n-3}\right]$
	\item $y^{n+1} = -y^{n} + y^{n-1} + y^{n-2} + 2h\left[f^{n} + f^{n-1}\right]$
\end{enumerate}
Here $k$ is the time-step, i.e.\ $k=(b-a)/N$ for some positive integer $N$.

The (incomplete) table below summarizes their properties.  Complete the missing
entries of this table (you need not supply any derivations), draw the corresponding
stencil, state the generating polynomials $\rho(w)$ and $\sigma(w)$, and state
the number of steps $r$.
